        <h3>Summary</h3>
      </hgroup>
      <p>
        <def>Nomic</def> is a game about making rules. Typically, the game
        starts with a basic ruleset, which describes how rules may be created,
        and the game evolves based on the choices of the players. Because of
        this, games can vary widely.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a webchat version of Nomic, where the rules are enforced by
        the server. To make this possible, rules are limited to the scope of
        messages: each rule can only refer to the content of the messages.
        Messages that violate any current rules will not be sent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note: the domain of this Nomic implementation is so restricted that it
        isn't really a Nomic game anymore. The game will probably get a more
        accurate (and interesting) name during development.
